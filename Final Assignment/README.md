This assignment contains the python file for implementing the RRT_algorithm in 3D without obstacles and with obstacles too. The algorithm plans an obstacle-free path in both the scenarios
The number of iterations play a very key role here as otherwise it is not able to plan a path under 1000 iterations as it generates random nodes which may or may not be in the direction of the goal node...The algorithm just ends up on a random node in such a case
Also the distance of the random node generated from the nearby nodes (random.randn()*distance) also needs to be set appropriately as when I tried with a step length of 10 initially; the number of iterations surpassed 2000 iterations using up all the RAM and eventually the execution crashed.
Afterwards after trying several permutations I was successfully able to plan a path with max_iterations=2000 and a step_length of 20 for generating random nodes. The crux is to come up with an optimal number of max_iterations such that it is enough to reach the goal and also taking into account RAM consumption while increasing the max_iterations. And also we need to choose a large step length so that it is able to find the goal given the number of iterations. Also exceeding it too much can generate nodes which can even cross the grid boundary !!!
